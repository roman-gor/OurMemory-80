## 📚 Project Overview  

This project explores the integration of **modern mobile architectures** and **networked data acquisition** in a real-world educational setting.  
It aims to demonstrate a modular, maintainable, and testable approach to building Android applications that manage structured historical datasets.  

Key objectives include:  
- Creating a **responsive, Jetpack Compose-based UI**.  
- Implementing a **clean architecture** to separate domain, data, and presentation layers.  
- Utilizing **MVVM** for lifecycle-aware, reactive state management.  
- Applying **Hilt** for dependency injection and component lifecycle control.  
- Accessing historical data through **Retrofit** with **Yandex Kit API** integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Kotlin** — primary programming language  
- **Jetpack Compose** — modern declarative UI toolkit  
- **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** — separation of concerns and reactive state management  
- **Clean Architecture** — layered modular structure for scalability and testability  
- **Hilt (Dagger)** — dependency injection  
- **Retrofit** — network requests and REST API integration  
- **Yandex Kit API** — fetching and processing historical/geographical data  
- **Coroutines & Flow** — asynchronous and reactive programming

## 🚀 Features  

- 🗺️ **Interactive Cemetery Map** — navigate and explore memorials  
- 📝 **Detailed Memorial Information** — historical context, images, and metadata  
- 🔍 **Search and Filter** — find specific memorials by name, date, or category  
- ⚙️ **Configurable Display Options** — adjust map layers, themes, and content visibility  
- 🧩 **Structured Data Presentation** — adheres to best practices in educational and historical data digitization

## 🔧 Architecture & Design Principles  

The application is designed with principles of **software modularity, scalability, and testability**:  

- **Domain layer** — independent of frameworks, containing core business logic  
- **Data layer** — repositories, remote API services, and caching  
- **Presentation layer** — Jetpack Compose UI with ViewModel and LiveData / StateFlow  
- **Dependency injection layer** — Hilt ensures lifecycle-aware, decoupled components  

The architecture emphasizes **reactive programming** and **clean separation of concerns**, making the app both maintainable and extensible for future research or educational expansion.

## 📌 Status  
The project is **actively developed as part of a college curriculum**.  
Future enhancements include:  
- 🔗 **Integration of augmented reality markers** for immersive cemetery exploration  
- 📊 **Analytics and statistics dashboards** for historical research  
- 🖼️ **Enhanced media management** (photos, documents, 3D scans)
